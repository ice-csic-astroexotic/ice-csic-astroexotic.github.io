  <p>Our activities focus mainly on the study of the multi-band emission of <b>magnetars</b>, the
  strongest magnetised neutron stars.</p>
    
  <p>Using approved programs for both <b>ground-based telescopes</b> (e.g. Parkes, GBT, ATCA) and
  <b>orbiting high-energy satellites</b> (e.g. NICER, Swift, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Chandra),
  observations of magnetars are performed as soon as they <b>experience so-called X-ray
  outbursts</b>. These episodes manifest as order of magnitude increases in the flux of the
  persistent X-ray emission and are typically pinpointed following the detection of short
  X-ray bursts - a hallmark of these peculiar sources - from all-sky monitors. <b>These
  outbursts provide a unique test bed to investigate the emission physics</b> of these
  sources. Observational studies focus in particular on their temporal and spectral
  properties and their evolution as they recover the quiescent state. Such studies make it
  possible to <b>map the thermal emission on the stellar surface</b>, understand the contribution
  of magnetospheric processes to the observed emission, establish the physical conditions
  that allow the pulsed and bursting radio emission to be triggered, and ultimately
  </b>estimate key source properties such as the characteristic age, the dipole magnetic field
  at the surface, and the rotational energy loss rate</b>.</p>

  <p>An additional ongoing project involves the development of <b>algorithms and pipelines to
  search for transient events and periodic or aperiodic sources</b> in the data of several
  publicly available multi-band catalogues. The ultimate goal of this project is to
  increase the number of known magnetars through the discovery of outburst activities that
  possibly passed unnoticed in the past and/or the onset of pulsed emission (typically at
  periods of the order of a second or longer). In recent years, a few research teams have
  begun to apply such algorithms to data of a small number of X-ray satellites. Our work
  aims to <b>systematically extend these searches to high-energy data collected by other
  satellites</b> (including gamma-ray satellites) as well as <b>data at other wavelengths</b>. 
  State-of-the-art pipelines will be adapted so as to cope with the different formats of the
  data produced by the different telescopes. The potential for new discoveries is
  extremely promising.</p>
