<div class="main-content" style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>The <b>neutron star population is dominated by radio pulsars</b>. However in the last decades, <b>several
  extreme and puzzling subclasses of neutron stars</b> have been discovered: Anomalous X-ray Pulsars
  (AXPs), Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs), Rotating Radio Transients (RRAT), X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron
  stars (XINSs), Central Compact Objects (CCOs) as well as the more common X-ray binary neutron stars
  accreting material from a low-mass or high-mass companion star. In particular, despite being
  governed by a single equation of state, the <b>neutron star zoo manifests itself as a multifaceted
  population</b>: some neutron stars are observed to emit only in radio, others seem to emit only high-
  energy radiation in the form of X-rays and gamma rays. Some show continuous activity, while others
  are capable of emitting sudden powerful transients. This <b>puzzling variety of observational
  properties is still largely unexplained</b>. Additionally, we know that neutron stars are the compact
  remnants of massive stars that end their lives in Core Collapse Supernovae. To accommodate limits
  of the death rate of such massive stars in our Galaxy (around 1-3 per century), <b>different neutron
  star classes are likely related and can be linked through evolution</b>. Despite observations being
  plentiful, we are far from understanding connections between these different classes and a unified
  scenario.</p>

  <p>Therefore, <b>one of the main objectives of population synthesis studies is to reconstruct, from a
  statistical point of view, the unknown distributions of physical properties</b> that characterise the
  initial population. The general approach is to use the present-day observed properties of neutron stars,
  together with some assumptions and theoretical models about their time evolution, to reconstruct
  the birth distribution of physical properties such as their natal kick velocities, spin periods and
  magnetic field strengths (see e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...643..332F/abstract" target="_blank">Faucher-Gigu&egrave;re and Kaspi, 2006</a>,
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454..615G/abstract" target="_blank">Gull&oacute;n et al., 2015</a>,
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.4043C/abstract" target="_blank">Ci&eacute;slar et al., 2020</a>).
  We are developing ML-Poppyns (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...916..100R/abstract" target="_blank">Ronchi et al., 2021</a>,
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...968...16G/abstract" target="_blank">Graber et al., 2024</a>,
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...696A.114P/abstract" target="_blank">Pardo Araujo et al. 2025</a>),
  a population-synthesis framework where <b>different neutron star populations can be simulated starting from
  various initial conditions</b> in terms of birth positions, velocities, spin periods and magnetic field strengths.
  Their initial properties are then evolved in time until the present day. In particular, we model the motion of
  the neutron stars in the Galaxy, the magnetic field decay, the secular spin-down evolution due to the emission
  of electromagnetic radiation and magnetospheric torques and their radiative emission at different electromagnetic
  wavelengths: radio, X-rays and gamma rays.</p>

  <p>Finally, in order to <b>perform a comparison with observed data</b>, we need to account for observational
  limitations. This is incorporated by applying filters and selection biases that are able to mimic
  the limited sensitivity of real surveys. In this way, <b>mock populations can be constructed and
  compared with the real observed populations</b> at different wavelengths. The comparison with
  observation is <b>challenging as our parameter space is highly multi-dimensional</b>. However, this
  comparison is necessary to constrains theoretical models used in the simulations and distributions
  of birth properties of the population. For this purpose, we <b>take advantage of the power of machine
  learning</b>, especially an approach called <b>Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)</b>
    (see e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PNAS..11730055C/abstract" target="_blank">Cranmer et al. 2020</a>).
  For complex and computationally expensive simulations, the likelihood function cannot be computed explicitly,
  and SBI overcomes this limitation by training neural networks (neural density estimators) on simulated data to
  <b>learn a mapping between model parameters and simulated observables</b> and reconstruct an approximation of the
  posterior distribution of the model parameters. To process and compress the information contained in the simulated
  data we adopt convolutional neural networks. These <b>neural networks are able to learn complex
  patterns and extract information</b> from the multi-dimensional data provided by our simulations and
  have the power of generalising to unseen data samples, such as the true observed neutron star
  population. In this way, we aim to provide a framework to interpret the features of entire Galactic
  neutron star population in an omni-comprehensive way.</p>

  ML-Poppyns will be the first population-synthesis framework to <b>incorporate information coming from the
  multi-wavelength observations of neutron stars</b>, from radio to X-rays and gamma rays.
  This will allow us to better constrain the birth properties of the observed Galactic population of neutron stars
  and to shed light on the origin of their different sub-classes in a unified scenario.</p>
