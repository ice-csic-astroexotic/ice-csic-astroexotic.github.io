<div class="main-content" style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>The <b>neutron star population is dominated by radio pulsars</b>. However in the last decades, <b>several 
  extreme and puzzling subclasses of neutron stars</b> have been discovered: Anomalous X-ray Pulsars 
  (AXPs), Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs), Rotating Radio Transients (RRAT), X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron 
  stars (XINSs), Central Compact Objects (CCOs) as well as the more common X-ray binary neutron stars 
  accreting material from a low-mass or high-mass companion star. In particular, despite being 
  governed by a single equation of state, the <b>neutron star zoo manifests itself as a multifaceted 
  population</b>: some neutron stars are observed to emit only in radio, others seem to emit only high-
  energy radiation in the form of X-rays and gamma rays. Some show continuous activity, while others 
  are capable of emitting sudden powerful transients. This <b>puzzling variety of observational 
  properties is still largely unexplained</b>. Additionally, we know that neutron stars are the compact 
  remnants of massive stars that end their lives in Core Collapse Supernovae. To accommodate limits 
  of the death rate of such massive stars in our Galaxy (around 1-3 per century), <b>different neutron 
  star classes are likely related and can be linked through evolution</b>. Despite observations being 
  plentiful, we are far from understanding connections between these different classes and a unified 
  scenario.</p>

  <p>Therefore, <b>one of the main objectives of population synthesis studies is to reconstruct, from a 
  statistical point of view, the unknown distributions of physical properties</b> that characterise the 
  initial population. The general approach is to use the present-day observed properties of pulsars, 
  together with some assumptions and theoretical models about their time evolution, to reconstruct 
  the birth distribution of physical properties such as their natal kick velocities, spin periods and 
  magnetic field strengths. In our population-synthesis framework <b>different neutron star populations 
  can be simulated starting from various initial conditions</b> in terms of birth positions, velocities, 
  spin periods and magnetic field strengths. Their initial properties are then evolved in time until 
  the present day. In particular, we model the motion of the neutron stars in the Galaxy, the secular 
  spin-down evolution due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation and magnetospheric torques and 
  their radiative emission at different electromagnetic wavelengths: radio, X-rays and gamma rays.</p> 

  <p>Finally, in order to <b>perform a comparison with observed data</b>, we need to account for observational 
  limitations. This is incorporated by applying filters and selection biases that are able to mimic 
  the limited sensitivity of real surveys. In this way, <b>mock populations can be constructed and 
  compared with the real observed populations</b> at different wavelengths. The comparison with 
  observation is <b>challenging as our parameter space is highly multi-dimensional</b>. However, this 
  comparison is necessary to constrains theoretical models used in the simulations and distributions 
  of birth properties of the population. For this purpose, we <b>take advantage of the power of machine 
  learning</b>, especially convolutional neural networks. These <b>neural networks are able to learn complex 
  patterns and extract information</b> from the multi-dimensional data provided by our simulations and 
  have the power of generalising to unseen data samples, such as the true observed neutron star 
  population. In this way, we aim to provide a framework to interpret the features of entire Galactic 
  neutron star population in an omni-comprehensive way.</p>

  <p>The population-synthesis framework we are developing will be the first one to <b>incorporate 
  information coming from the multi-wavelength observations of neutron stars</b>, from radio to X-rays 
  and gamma rays. This will allow us to better constrain the birth properties of the observed 
  Galactic population of neutron stars and to shed light on the origin of their different sub-classes 
  in a unified scenario.</p>
