  <p>X-ray Pulsar Autonomous Space Navigation is an emerging technology with the potential to 
  revolutionize space travel by providing autonomous, precise, and reliable positioning for 
  spacecraft without relying on Earth-based support. Similar to the Global Positioning System (GPS), 
  this technique enables spacecraft to determine their position by triangulating the highly stable, 
  clock-like signals emitted by X-ray pulsars.</p>

  <p>Building on our initial work within the PODIUM project (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08744" target="_blank">arxiv:2301.08744</a>), in 
  collaboration with SENER Aerospace and Deimos Aerospace under an ESA ITT grant, we have explored 
  the design of a spacecraft navigation unit capable of detecting pulsar signals, measuring the 
  spacecraft's distance from the solar system barycenter, and performing onboard orbit determination. 
  PODIUM addressed the overall unit architecture, optical and thermomechanical design, avionics and 
  software, and performance under realistic mission constraints.</p>

  <p>With <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/news/2000th-erc-proof-concept-grant-awarded" target="_blank">DeepSpacePULSE</a>
  (ERC POC grant 2024), we are extending these efforts toward a compact, efficient, and flight-ready 
  payload suitable for deep-space missions. Our work focuses on improving detector sensitivity, 
  timing precision, and onboard data processing to deliver reliable position and velocity estimates 
  in real time. By integrating the full navigation chainâ€”from signal detection to orbit determination
  - within a lightweight, mission-ready system, we aim to enable fully autonomous interplanetary 
  navigation and reduce dependence on Earth-based tracking, paving the way for more resilient and 
  flexible deep-space exploration.</p>
