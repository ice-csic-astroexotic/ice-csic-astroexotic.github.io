<div class="main-content" style="text-align: justify;">
  <p> ML-Poppyns is a new population synthesis framework for Galactic neutron stars that employs deep learning and
  simulation based inference (SBI) to investigate the birth, evolution and emission properties of the neutron star population in our Galaxy.
  It starts from some initial conditions on the birth positions in the Galaxy, kick velocities, birth spin-periods and magnetic field distributions.
  It then performs dynamical and magneto-rotational evolution to generate an evolved population of neutron star.
  Finally it models the radio emission and detection with radio surveys.
  To perform parameter inference it employs the power of neural networks, in particular a neural density estimator is trained on simulated data
  to learn a mapping between model parameters and simulated observables and reconstruct an approximation of the posterior distribution of the model parameters.
  Once trained the neural density estimator can be applied to the true observed neutron star population to infer its physical properties.</p>
