    <p>EXOTIC's research focuses on the neutron star population, its diversity and connection with 
    the Universe's most transient events. Below we describe four research lines that we are 
    currently actively investigating.</p>

    <h1 id="multiw">Multi-Wavelength Observations of Compact Objects</h1>
    <p>Our activities focus mainly on the study of the multi-band emission of <b>magnetars</b>, the
    strongest magnetised neutron stars.</p>
    
    <p>Using approved programs for both <b>ground-based telescopes</b> (e.g. Parkes, GBT, ATCA) and
    <b>orbiting high-energy satellites</b> (e.g. NICER, Swift, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Chandra),
    observations of magnetars are performed as soon as they <b>experience so-called X-ray
    outbursts</b>. These episodes manifest as order of magnitude increases in the flux of the
    persistent X-ray emission and are typically pinpointed following the detection of short
    X-ray bursts - a hallmark of these peculiar sources - from all-sky monitors. <b>These
    outbursts provide a unique test bed to investigate the emission physics</b> of these
    sources. Observational studies focus in particular on their temporal and spectral
    properties and their evolution as they recover the quiescent state. Such studies make it
    possible to <b>map the thermal emission on the stellar surface</b>, understand the contribution
    of magnetospheric processes to the observed emission, establish the physical conditions
    that allow the pulsed and bursting radio emission to be triggered, and ultimately
    </b>estimate key source properties such as the characteristic age, the dipole magnetic field
    at the surface, and the rotational energy loss rate</b>.</p>

    <p>An additional ongoing project involves the development of <b>algorithms and pipelines to
    search for transient events and periodic or aperiodic sources</b> in the data of several
    publicly available multi-band catalogues. The ultimate goal of this project is to
    increase the number of known magnetars through the discovery of outburst activities that
    possibly passed unnoticed in the past and/or the onset of pulsed emission (typically at
    periods of the order of a second or longer). In recent years, a few research teams have
    begun to apply such algorithms to data of a small number of X-ray satellites. Our work
    aims to <b>systematically extend these searches to high-energy data collected by other
    satellites</b> (including gamma-ray satellites) as well as <b>data at other wavelengths</b>. 
    State-of-the-art pipelines will be adapted so as to cope with the different formats of the
    data produced by the different telescopes. The potential for new discoveries is
    extremely promising.</p>

    <h1 id="magnetotherm">Magneto-thermal Evolution of Neutron Stars</h1>
    <p>In the last decades, 2D studies in axial symmetry have been carried out to explore in detail the 
    cooling of strongly magnetized neutron stars and the interplay between the thermal and magnetic 
    evolution (Pons, Miralles & Geppert 2009; Viganò, Rea, Pons et al. 2013). The first attempts to 
    extend this to 3D were <b>limited to the magnetic evolution without taking into account the thermal 
    one</b>, which increases substantially the computational load (Gourgouliatos & Cumming 2014, 
    Gougouliatos et al. 2016; Bansgrove, Levin & Beloborodov 2018) or included it in a very schematic 
    fashion (Igoshev et al. 2020, De Grandis et al. 2020). In this respect, <b>we built a complete 3D 
    magneto-thermal evolution model</b> (with the crucial help of long standing collaborators working in 
    numerical simulations: see e.g. Viganò et al. 2013, 2021).</p>

    <p>The 3D magneto-thermal evolution code <b>MATINS (Dehman et al 2023, Ascenzi et al 2024) closes this 
    gap</b> by building a complete self consistent and detailed 3D  model. This is crucial since (i) 
    magnetic field evolution is an important ingredient for <b>pulsar population synthesis</b> as magnetic 
    field changes affect the stellar rotational properties, which are the key ingredient to extract 
    pulsar properties at birth from observations, (ii) <b>the burst activity</b> of magnetars is driven by 
    magnetic field evolution and the release of accumulated crustal stresses (Pons & Rea 2012; 
    Beloborodov & Levin 2014; Li et al. 2016); modelling the magneto-thermal evolution is thus needed 
    to predict flaring rates. For realistic predictions, 3D models are necessary to properly model 
    current flows over the entire neutron star surface and incorporate <b>realistic, non-axisymmetric 
    field geometries</b>. This new allows us to  determine cooling curves to be constrained 
    observationally, and will be used to predict magnetar flaring rate as a function of age and 
    magnetic strength/geometry at birth.</p>

    <h1 id="popsynth">Population Synthesis of Galactic Neutron Stars</h1>
    <p>The <b>neutron star population is dominated by radio pulsars</b>. However in the last decades, <b>several 
    extreme and puzzling subclasses of neutron stars</b> have been discovered: Anomalous X-ray Pulsars 
    (AXPs), Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs), Rotating Radio Transients (RRAT), X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron 
    stars (XINSs), Central Compact Objects (CCOs) as well as the more common X-ray binary neutron stars 
    accreting material from a low-mass or high-mass companion star. In particular, despite being 
    governed by a single equation of state, the <b>neutron star zoo manifests itself as a multifaceted 
    population</b>: some neutron stars are observed to emit only in radio, others seem to emit only high-
    energy radiation in the form of X-rays and gamma rays. Some show continuous activity, while others 
    are capable of emitting sudden powerful transients. This <b>puzzling variety of observational 
    properties is still largely unexplained</b>. Additionally, we know that neutron stars are the compact 
    remnants of massive stars that end their lives in Core Collapse Supernovae. To accommodate limits 
    of the death rate of such massive stars in our Galaxy (around 1-3 per century), <b>different neutron 
    star classes are likely related and can be linked through evolution</b>. Despite observations being 
    plentiful, we are far from understanding connections between these different classes and a unified 
    scenario.</p>

    <p>Therefore, <b>one of the main objectives of population synthesis studies is to reconstruct, from a 
    statistical point of view, the unknown distributions of physical properties</b> that characterise the 
    initial population. The general approach is to use the present-day observed properties of pulsars, 
    together with some assumptions and theoretical models about their time evolution, to reconstruct 
    the birth distribution of physical properties such as their natal kick velocities, spin periods and 
    magnetic field strengths. In our population-synthesis framework <b>different neutron star populations 
    can be simulated starting from various initial conditions</b> in terms of birth positions, velocities, 
    spin periods and magnetic field strengths. Their initial properties are then evolved in time until 
    the present day. In particular, we model the motion of the neutron stars in the Galaxy, the secular 
    spin-down evolution due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation and magnetospheric torques and 
    their radiative emission at different electromagnetic wavelengths: radio, X-rays and gamma rays.</p> 

    <p>Finally, in order to <b>perform a comparison with observed data</b>, we need to account for observational 
    limitations. This is incorporated by applying filters and selection biases that are able to mimic 
    the limited sensitivity of real surveys. In this way, <b>mock populations can be constructed and 
    compared with the real observed populations</b> at different wavelengths. The comparison with 
    observation is <b>challenging as our parameter space is highly multi-dimensional</b>. However, this 
    comparison is necessary to constrains theoretical models used in the simulations and distributions 
    of birth properties of the population. For this purpose, we <b>take advantage of the power of machine 
    learning</b>, especially convolutional neural networks. These <b>neural networks are able to learn complex 
    patterns and extract information</b> from the multi-dimensional data provided by our simulations and 
    have the power of generalising to unseen data samples, such as the true observed neutron star 
    population. In this way, we aim to provide a framework to interpret the features of entire Galactic 
    neutron star population in an omni-comprehensive way.</p>

    <p>The population-synthesis framework we are developing will be the first one to <b>incorporate 
    information coming from the multi-wavelength observations of neutron stars</b>, from radio to X-rays 
    and gamma rays. This will allow us to better constrain the birth properties of the observed 
    Galactic population of neutron stars and to shed light on the origin of their different sub-classes 
    in a unified scenario.</p>

    <h1 id="podium">PODIUM: Navigation Unit Based on X-ray Pulsars</h1>
    <p>X-ray Pulsar Autonomous Space Navigation is an emerging technology with the potential to 
    revolutionize space travel by providing autonomous, precise, and reliable positioning for 
    spacecraft without relying on Earth-based support. Similar to the Global Positioning System (GPS), 
    this technique enables spacecraft to determine their position by triangulating the highly stable, 
    clock-like signals emitted by X-ray pulsars.</p>

    <p>Building on our initial work within the PODIUM project (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08744" target="_blank">arxiv:2301.08744</a>), in 
    collaboration with SENER Aerospace and Deimos Aerospace under an ESA ITT grant, we have explored 
    the design of a spacecraft navigation unit capable of detecting pulsar signals, measuring the 
    spacecraft's distance from the solar system barycenter, and performing onboard orbit determination. 
    PODIUM addressed the overall unit architecture, optical and thermomechanical design, avionics and 
    software, and performance under realistic mission constraints.</p>

    <p>With <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/news/2000th-erc-proof-concept-grant-awarded" target="_blank">DeepSpacePULSE</a>
    (ERC POC grant 2024), we are extending these efforts toward a compact, efficient, and flight-ready 
    payload suitable for deep-space missions. Our work focuses on improving detector sensitivity, 
    timing precision, and onboard data processing to deliver reliable position and velocity estimates 
    in real time. By integrating the full navigation chain—from signal detection to orbit determination
    - within a lightweight, mission-ready system, we aim to enable fully autonomous interplanetary 
    navigation and reduce dependence on Earth-based tracking, paving the way for more resilient and 
    flexible deep-space exploration.</p>
