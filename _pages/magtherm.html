  <p>In the last decades, 2D studies in axial symmetry have been carried out to explore in detail the 
  cooling of strongly magnetized neutron stars and the interplay between the thermal and magnetic 
  evolution (Pons, Miralles & Geppert 2009; Viganò, Rea, Pons et al. 2013). The first attempts to 
  extend this to 3D were <b>limited to the magnetic evolution without taking into account the thermal 
  one</b>, which increases substantially the computational load (Gourgouliatos & Cumming 2014, 
  Gougouliatos et al. 2016; Bansgrove, Levin & Beloborodov 2018) or included it in a very schematic 
  fashion (Igoshev et al. 2020, De Grandis et al. 2020). On the other hand, long standing collaborators
  of the group developed the state-of-the-art of 2D numerical simulations, e.g. Viganò et al. 2013, 2021).</p>

  <p>The 3D magneto-thermal evolution code <b>MATINS (Dehman et al 2023, Ascenzi et al 2024) closes this 
  gap</b> by building a complete self consistent and detailed 3D model. This is crucial since (i) 
  magnetic field evolution is an important ingredient for <b>pulsar population synthesis</b> as magnetic 
  field changes affect the stellar rotational properties, which are the key ingredient to extract 
  pulsar properties at birth from observations, (ii) <b>the burst activity</b> of magnetars is driven by 
  magnetic field evolution and the release of accumulated crustal stresses (Pons & Rea 2012; 
  Beloborodov & Levin 2014; Li et al. 2016); modelling the magneto-thermal evolution is thus needed 
  to predict flaring rates. For realistic predictions, 3D models are necessary to properly model 
  current flows over the entire neutron star surface and incorporate <b>realistic, non-axisymmetric 
  field geometries</b>. This new allows us to  determine cooling curves to be constrained 
  observationally, and will be used to predict magnetar flaring rate as a function of age and 
  magnetic strength/geometry at birth.</p>
 
  Moreover, we developed new models of NS thermal evolution over <b>short time scales</b>, which requires
  a more accurate treatment of the outermost NS layers (KOvlakas, De Grandis & Rea 2025). We used this to
  model <b>magnetar outbursts</b>,  a type of activity connected to the appearance of thermal features on 
  NS surfaces (De Grandis, Rea et al. 2025)
