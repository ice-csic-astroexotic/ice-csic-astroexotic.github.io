<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My current Ph.D. project is mainly focused on searching for pulsars and transients from multi-band 
    frequency (i.e., from Radio to Gamma-ray). This will be achieved by developing a pipeline to 
    perform the searching and look for pulsar candidates. In a later stage, the project will also involve 
    using Machine Learning algorithms to manage the classification of the produced images, which will 
    increase the searching processes.</p>

<h3>Master project</h3>
<p>I present an analysis of the dispersion measure (DM) variations for 68 pulsars. The observations 
    were taken using six International LOFAR Stations in Europe over the period of 3.5 years (between 
    June 2014 and November 2017) at the centre frequency of 150 MHz with 80 MHz of bandwidth. During 
    this time each pulsar was observed on a weekly basis, resulting in an average of 160 observations 
    per source.</p>

<p>I show that the variations of the DM measurements present various trends along the span of the 
    observation, e.g., increasing or decreasing, and in some cases more changes from one trend to another.</p>

<p>I perform the structure-function analysis to check whether the measured DM variations follow the 
    Kolmogorov power spectrum or not (this spectrum describes the turbulence structure of the interstellar medium (ISM)).</p>

<p>The result shows that a number of pulsars appear to be consistent with the Kolmogorov distribution 
    (e.g., PSRs J1913-0440 and J2157+4017) while other sources show significant differences (e.g., 
    PSRs J0108+6608 and J0614+2229). I also obtain the DM derivatives (i.e., dDM/dt) for each pulsar, 
    in order to examine the correlation between the DM and its derivative.</p>

<p>The result of this correlation shows the best fit with a square-root dependence of 0.6±0.2, which
     is comparable with the result previously obtained by Hobbs et al. (2004), who showed a square-root 
     dependence between the DM and its derivative with a gradient of 0.57±0.09.</p>

<p>Finally, one of the major results of this study, thanks to the pulsar timing analysis, allowed me 
    to produce a new timing solution for three pulsars: PSRs J0613+3731, J0815+4611, and J1740+27.</p>
